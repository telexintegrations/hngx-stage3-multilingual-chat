# Multilingual Chat: A Telex Modifier Integrations

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This integration will automatically translate incoming messages to a specified language. It will detect the language of incoming messages and translate them to user selected language, making communication more inclusive and accessible.

---

## Integration Overview
I built a Modifier Integrations, out of the following types of Telex integrations:

1. *Modifier Integrations*: Modify new messages entering a channel (e.g., profanity filter, text translator).
2. *Interval Integrations*: Send messages to a channel at set intervals (e.g., Bitcoin price tracker, website uptime monitor).
3. *Output Integrations*: Route data from a Telex channel to external services (e.g., email notifications, Discord webhooks).

My integration adhered to the Telex documentation and best coding practices.

## Resources
I made sure that I review the following resources before starting the integration:
- [Telex Documentation](https://telex.im)
- [Integration Settings Spec](https://docs.telex.im/docs/Integrations/settings)
- [GitHub Best Practices](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- [Good vs Bad Commit Messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- [How to Write Better Git Commit Messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
